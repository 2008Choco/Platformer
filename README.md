## General Information ##

This is a project that was started back in early April of 2016. The entire purpose of this project is to create a game completely made in the language of Java using Java's Graphics objects and Java Swing's frames and canvases. Every bit of code was written by myself as a school project and for no other purpose. There is no intention of releasing this game publicly or allowing people to play it (Excluding those that I allow to test the game)

All code released to the public repository is available for your usage should you choose to learn from it. This code is by no means the most efficient, nor the best way to do what I'm doing. This is for educational purposes and I am in no way responsible for the way you use any of the code. I still however claim the rights to all code written, (View "Legal Information" for more information about legal rights)
