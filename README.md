This project started back in early April of 2016. The entire purpose of this project was to create a game completely made in Java using its Swing framework. All code was written by myself as a school project and for no other purpose. There is no intention of releasing this game publicly or allowing people to play it (Excluding those that I allow to test the game)

All code released to the public repository is available for your usage should you choose to learn from it (although this is ill-advised - it's horrible inefficient). This is for educational purposes and I am in no way responsible for the way you use any of the code.

<strong>Notice:</strong><i> I do not claim the rights to the images used within this project unless otherwise stated. Most images are used from external sources and are not meant for any other reason other than educational purposes. Any externally created textures are not permanent and will eventually be removed from the project all together for a custom texture</i>
